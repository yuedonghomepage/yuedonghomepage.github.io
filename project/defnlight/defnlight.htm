    <p class="Abstract">
We present deferred neural lighting, a novel method for free-viewpoint re-
lighting from unstructured photographs of a scene captured with handheld
devices. Our method leverages a scene-dependent neural rendering network
for relighting a rough geometric proxy with learnable neural textures. Key
to making the rendering network lighting aware are radiance cues: global il-
lumination renderings of a rough proxy geometry of the scene for a small set
of basis materials and lit by the target lighting. As such, the light transport
through the scene is never explicitely modeled,but resolved at rendering time
by a neural rendering network. We demonstrate that the neural textures and
neural renderer can be trained end-to-end from unstructured photographs
captured with a double hand-held camera setup that concurrently captures
the scene while being lit by only one of the cameras’ flash lights. In addi-
tion, we propose a novel augmentation refinement strategy that exploits
the linearity of light transport to extend the relighting capabilities of the
neural rendering network to support other lighting types (e.g., environment lighting) beyond the lighting used during acquisition (i.e., flash lighting). We
demonstrate our deferred neural lighting solution on a variety of real-world
and synthetic scenes exhibiting a wide range of material properties, light
transport effects, and geometrical complexity.
